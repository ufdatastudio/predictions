      "89        Much as I think this guy is a depressing twat, he maybe right for once, given that President Trump would be hard pushed to put his faith in the secret service right now, having survived all that the fffffff from the deep state could throw at him.Earlier on Friday, news broke that Trump is expected to hire Sean Curran to lead the U.S. Secret Service. Curran, who has served as the head of Trump’s protective detail since he left office, was by his side as he was shot in July. Since then, he has helped conduct a top-to-bottom review of the detachment’s shortcomings, especially since it was revealed that some of the agents on Trump’s detail were walking away from their posts or allowing unknown individuals to sneak into his speeches.Watch:https://x.com/glennbeck/status/1880326265200062567   \n",

We are now in day 1. However, this day is expected to be slow.1. The President-Elect will hold an evening reception and fireworks show at Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia, outside the city. This will apparently be his only public event of the day since the Trump transition team have not said how will Trump spend the 1st part of the day.2. During the evening reception at Trump’s golf club, Vice President Elect JD Vance will attend a reception for Cabinet members and host a dinner in Washington.   \n",

       "  89        Much as I think this guy is a depressing twat, he maybe right for once, given that President Trump would be hard pushed to put his faith in the secret service right now, having survived all that the fffffff from the deep state could throw at him.Earlier on Friday, news broke that Trump is expected to hire Sean Curran to lead the U.S. Secret Service. Curran, who has served as the head of Trump’s protective detail since he left office, was by his side as he was shot in July. Since then, he has helped conduct a top-to-bottom review of the detachment’s shortcomings, especially since it was revealed that some of the agents on Trump’s detail were walking away from their posts or allowing unknown individuals to sneak into his speeches.Watch:https://x.com/glennbeck/status/1880326265200062567   \n",

We are now in day 1. However, this day is expected to be slow.1. The President-Elect will hold an evening reception and fireworks show at Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia, outside the city. This will apparently be his only public event of the day since the Trump transition team have not said how will Trump spend the 1st part of the day.2. During the evening reception at Trump’s golf club, Vice President Elect JD Vance will attend a reception for Cabinet members and host a dinner in Washington.   \n",

We are now in day 1. However, this day is expected to be slow.1. The President-Elect will hold an evening reception and fireworks show at Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia, outside the city. This will apparently be his only public event of the day since the Trump transition team have not said how will Trump spend the 1st part of the day.2. During the evening reception at Trump’s golf club, Vice President Elect JD Vance will attend a reception for Cabinet members and host a dinner in Washington.   \n",
