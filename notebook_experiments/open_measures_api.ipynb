Lower terms \"rigged\", anywhere there is big money, we all know who it is controlled by.  Like the Romans said, \"Make them an arena\".  Only a few big players, making the big money (hush money) get the play book way before the season starts and what is going to happen and to make it happen.  I believe many college sports are also, esp football $$$ .. but does not involve the players, it involves the coaches and the college, based on making the right plays or plays to make it fail on purpose.

Remember when the fans boycotted NFL because of disrespect while our National Anthem was being played, and they did it for you as well.

      "20  For some time, I feel the message to the public which many people know, the NFL, NBA etc are all manipulated.  Lower terms \"rigged\", anywhere there is big money, we all know who it is controlled by.  Like the Romans said, \"Make them an arena\".  Only a few big players, making the big money (hush money) get the play book way before the season starts and what is going to happen and to make it happen.  I believe many college sports are also, esp football $$$ .. but does not involve the players, it involves the coaches and the college, based on making the right plays or plays to make it fail on purpose.  Lets sit back and watch..  plus the Super Bowl is the highest human trafficking event all year.   Since White Hats have been in control, they have been scooping up many criminals involved t...   \n",

They should have never even made it to the playoffs. Many fans are disgusted with NFL and helping KC because of Taylor Swift! Many won’t watch Super Bowl because of it and are loosing fans. Remember when the fans boycotted NFL because of disrespect while our National Anthem was being played, and they did it for you as well. Please look into this so NFL doesn’t ruin the love of the great American game.Thank you for everything you do. You are Gods blessing.✝️🙏♥️   \n",

       "  20  <p>For some time, I feel the message to the public which many people know, the NFL, NBA etc are all manipulated.  Lower terms \"rigged\", anywhere there is big money, we all know who it is controlled by.  Like the Romans said, \"Make them an arena\".  Only a few big players, making the big money (hush money) get the play book way before the season starts and what is going to happen and to make it happen.  I believe many college sports are also, esp football $$$ .. but does not involve the players, it involves the coaches and the college, based on making the right plays or plays to make it fail on purpose.

Remember when the fans boycotted NFL because of disrespect while our National Anthem was being played, and they did it for you as well.

       "  20  For some time, I feel the message to the public which many people know, the NFL, NBA etc are all manipulated.  Lower terms \"rigged\", anywhere there is big money, we all know who it is controlled by.  Like the Romans said, \"Make them an arena\".  Only a few big players, making the big money (hush money) get the play book way before the season starts and what is going to happen and to make it happen.  I believe many college sports are also, esp football $$$ .. but does not involve the players, it involves the coaches and the college, based on making the right plays or plays to make it fail on purpose.

They should have never even made it to the playoffs. Many fans are disgusted with NFL and helping KC because of Taylor Swift! Many won’t watch Super Bowl because of it and are loosing fans. Remember when the fans boycotted NFL because of disrespect while our National Anthem was being played, and they did it for you as well. Please look into this so NFL doesn’t ruin the love of the great American game.Thank you for everything you do. You are Gods blessing.✝️🙏♥️   \n",

       "  20  For some time, I feel the message to the public which many people know, the NFL, NBA etc are all manipulated.  Lower terms \"rigged\", anywhere there is big money, we all know who it is controlled by.  Like the Romans said, \"Make them an arena\".  Only a few big players, making the big money (hush money) get the play book way before the season starts and what is going to happen and to make it happen.  I believe many college sports are also, esp football $$$ .. but does not involve the players, it involves the coaches and the college, based on making the right plays or plays to make it fail on purpose.  Lets sit back and watch..  plus the Super Bowl is the highest human trafficking event all year.   Since White Hats have been in control, they have been scooping up many criminals involved t...   \n",

They should have never even made it to the playoffs. Many fans are disgusted with NFL and helping KC because of Taylor Swift! Many won’t watch Super Bowl because of it and are loosing fans. Remember when the fans boycotted NFL because of disrespect while our National Anthem was being played, and they did it for you as well. Please look into this so NFL doesn’t ruin the love of the great American game.Thank you for everything you do. You are Gods blessing.✝️🙏♥️   \n",
