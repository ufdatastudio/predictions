    "- **Tasks:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. Find any pre-game YouTube clip where the sport analysts make predictions of which team they think will win.\n",
    "        - Ex. See [Immediate 2025 NCAA tournament Final Four and championship picks](https://youtu.be/-rjnvL9LL3U?si=QMFJYAQ8Q85lTNCD)\n",
    "    2. Find a post-game YouTube clip where the winning team (from 1) is announced.\n",
    "        - Ex. See [Florida vs. Houston - 2025 NCAA men’s national championship | FULL REPLAY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHJ90jJmCYw)\n",
    "    3. Use the [`youtube-transcript-api`](https://pypi.org/project/youtube-transcript-api/) to retrieve the transcript of both videos (from 1 and 2).\n",
    "    4. Extract the transcripts\n",
    "    5. Clean the data\n",
    "    6. Create prompt to identify predictions.\n",
    "    7. Pass each row from video 1 + prompt into the LLMs.\n",
    "    8. Majority Vote (MV) with LLMs\n",
    "    9. Filter by MV label = 1, hence prediction\n",
    "    10. For each prediction, compare with each observation sentence from video 2. \n",
    "    11. Prompt LLMs to identify if observation from video 2 is enough to state if each prediction came true.\n",
    "- **Misc:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. Watch the video first to ensure it contains predictions (the team that is predicted to win) and observations (the team that wins)\n",
    "    2. Shorten the transcript to only have predictions/observations"
