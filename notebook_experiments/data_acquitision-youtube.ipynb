      "He can't touch it. He can't. One second and it's over. Florida is back on top of the college basketball world championship madness. It's a great day to be a Gator. They win the national title. Houston did not get a shot off. Florida 65, Houston 63. And it's heartbreak once again for the Houston Cougars and Bird. They matched up beautifully on the perimeter. People made sure they weren't going to get a three. They used the clock. No direction whatsoever getting into the lane and great communication skills. Yeah, once again Clayton a beautiful close out at the end causing that almost a violation by Sharp. They tried to go to Crier here on the slap back. Pin down for Sharp and Clayton got out there contested. Sharp had to let the ball bounce and getting on the floor to win the championship. [Applause] Fantastic effort, fantastic second half and just beautiful execution defensively and right there icing, reacting and what a close out as you mentioned with Clayton and Houston was going for the three for the win. Alex Condidan hits the deck, secures it. Time expires on the Houston Cougars and utter elation for the Florida Gator. They are the 2025 national champions. And Bird, how appropriate is it ends up a loose ball on the floor against Houston at Florida Got it. The Florida Gator win their third title. And for Kelvin Samson and the Houston Cougars, this one is a gut punch. And and everybody who's coached or been in this game, your heart's broken for Kelvin. I mean, it's so meaningful obviously to any program or what he's put in, the blood, sweat, and tears and to coers this program with all the victories and success, it's heartbreaking. Florida wins it. We send it to Tracy. Coach, you told me that if you won this national championship, the feeling would be surreal. I can see the shock on your face right now. Take us through though the stretch of that game. You guys were down 12 points at one point. The fight that this team showed to get it done. We did what we did all year. We stayed the course. We have the best back court in America. I think we have the best front court in America. And like we've done all year, we made plays when we needed the most. We'd guard our butts off down the stretch. Made every 50/50 winning play. The Gators are natty, baby. We got the natty, baby. We got the natty. Let's go. Now, Will, you were his first commit. You guys lost in the first round and the turnaround you were able to do. What was the difference with this team this year? Uh, just how connected we are. I mean, we all love each other. We love playing for each other and we love being a Gator, man. and get it boys. Stay hot. Now, Walter, I know it wasn't the easiest game for you, but the feeling of being able to cut down the nets and hoist a national championship trophy, man. That's a feeling I can't even explain, man. I can't wait though. I love your mama. I can't wait to see my mama, man. Mama, I love you, girl. You guys go enjoy this one. Congratulations. Hey, shout out to all the people at the Odome. We had a sold out Odon tonight, baby. Let's go. [Applause] They've got the natty. Stunning ending here in the national championship. Welcome to Inside March Madness presented by Buick. Florida wins the title over Houston. Let's go to the podium and Ernie Johnson. Thank you, Ian. And a uh jubilant podium it is as the Florida Gator is celebrating a national championship. But San Antonio, what a job over the last few days. Three incredible games to get us to this point. Uh Bubba Cunningham, chairman of the selection committee, which had four number one seeds advanced to San Antonio and these great matchups. How would you best describe it, Bubba? Just an outstanding tournament. So, on behalf of the NCAA men's basketball committee, congratulations to the University of Florida Gator, the 2025 national champion. [Applause] Uh, Coach Golden, where is Todd? How are you? I'm amazing. Hey, this is uh this was your first chance. You're only 39 years old, too. Okay. You're the youngest head coach since Jimmy Valvano to claim a national championship. What does that mean to you? I I've just been incredibly blessed. I have an amazing staff. We clearly have the best team in America. And in three short years in Gainesville, we got the basketball program back where it belongs, which is raising trophies, playing in final fours and competing for national championships. Super fortunate to be with this group right here. Look, uh, in this run, you knocked out the reigning two-time champions. You knocked out two number one seeds to stand here tonight. And you had to do it in come from behind fashion, too. Where does the belief come when you're down 12 in the second half and and there's a struggle uh in the midst of this? Our our perimeter, our senior leaders have been amazing all year. They've kept us poised. They've kept us centered, grounded. We've had to come back quite a bit this uh tournament as you said, but these guys have been elite with their composure. Our young guys in the front court fight like hell for these seniors every day. They compete and they find a way to win. They are winners. They continue to find a way to win. Hey, I know that I know that like a lot of coaches, you have dreamt of this moment. My last question for you is, how do you like the view from up here? It's amazing. Thank you, Gator Nation. Thank you for coming and showing out for the Gator tonight. We love you guys. I'm glad we were able to make you proud tonight. Go Gators, baby. Gator. Can I get Walter Clayton Jr. Walter? Because the uh the most outstanding player here in San Antonio, Walter Clayton Jr. Appreciate you. Hey man, Gay Nation, man. We appreciate y'all. All the hard work we put in together. You know what that came, man? And that came to fruition, man. We done did it. So man, shout out Gator Nation, man. Go Gator. The boy stay hot. How, Walter, how do you navigate a game like this? You're coming off back-to-back 30-point games. Um, and then you don't get a bucket until 8 minutes to go in the game. How did you stay positive? How did you navigate this night? Man, we've been saying it all year, man. Our motto is we all can go, man. We got a team full of guys that could go. It ain't just about me. We got multiple guys on this go that could go get a bucket and do anything. So, my team held me down until I was able to put the ball in the basket. Shout out to them boys. Congratulations to you. Congratulations on that little daughter of yours too as well. I know this going to be a great celebration for you. Gator boy. Stay hot, man. These are your national champion Florida Gators. Congratulations. And again, thanks San Antonio Iron Eagle. EJ gritty, tough, resilient. Florida wins the national championship. Congratulations to Gator Nation. It's the third in Florida program history. 2006, 2007, 2025. [Applause] It belongs to\n"
